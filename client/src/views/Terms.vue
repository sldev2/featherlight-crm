                <li>
                  <strong>Taxable supply</strong><br />If GST is payable on any
                  supply made under this Agreement, the recipient of the supply
                  must pay an amount equal to the GST payable on the supply.
                  &nbsp;That amount must be paid at the same time that the
                  consideration is to be provided under this Agreement, and must
                  be paid in addition to the consideration expressed elsewhere
                  in this Agreement, unless it is expressed to be inclusive of
                  GST. The recipient is not required to pay any GST until the
                  supplier issues a tax invoice for the supply.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Adjustment events</strong><br />If an adjustment event
                  arises in respect of any supply made under this Agreement, a
                  corresponding adjustment must be made between the supplier and
                  the recipient in respect of any amount paid by the recipient
                  under this clause, an adjustment note issued (if required),
                  and any payments to give effect to the adjustment must be
                  made.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Payments</strong><br />If the recipient is required
                  under this Agreement<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to pay for or
                  reimburse an expense or outgoing of the supplier, or is
                  required to make a payment under an indemnity in respect of an
                  expense or outgoing of the supplier, the amount to be paid by
                  the recipient is to be reduced by the amount of any input tax
                  credit in respect of that expense or outgoing that the
                  supplier is entitled to.
